## Inspiration
My inspiration is to keep my personal diaries private while they are stored on the web, my reference is the chrome extension **My Diary** 

## What it does
This submission **Phase-One** displays a complete CRUD function where a user can create, read, update and delete diaries, with a clean minimalistic UI.

## How I built it
I build it with the Internet Computer .dfx SDK, Motoko back-end language, React.js for the front-end and IPad procreate for the landing page graphics. 

## Challenges I ran into
I learned about the blockchain technology while builing Dear Diary, I wish I have more time to submit a complete concept, but I will continue developing this application untill I meet my target.

## Accomplishments that I' am proud of
This application is very personal for me. I love my diary, I created many diaries through the years, my main challenge with diaries was either I lose them or I run out of pages and I have to start a new one. Until I found the chrome extension My Diary, typing a diary online has a different feeling to it, especially thinking how hackable the cloud is?!! With the new Web3 decentralized system, I can rest assured that my diaries are kept safe and private, until I am ready to share them or even sell them.

## What I learned
I have never heard of Web3 or the decentralized data system before. I read about blockchain on the news but never spent time understanding the technology behind it. As a software engineer, This hackathon allowed me to learn new tech skills while building Dear Diary on Web3 with the Internet Computer, .dfx SDK, and Motoko back-end language. 

## What's next for Dear Diary
My main strategy is to create a marketplace for users to sell online diaries as NFTs. This submission **Phase-One** displays a complete CRUD function where a user can create, read, update and delete. Next, connect the actual marketplace metaverse where users can discover other users' minted diaries as NFTs while allowing them to create, mint and list a diary of their choice as an NFT for sale.
