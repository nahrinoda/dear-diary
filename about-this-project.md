## Inspiration
My inspiration is chrome extension **My Diary** 

## What it does
**Phase-One:**  this phase allows users to create, edit or delete their private diaries, with a clean minimalistic UI.

## How I built it
I build it with the Internet Computer .dfx SDK, Motoko back-end language, React.js for the front-end and IPad procreate for the landing page graphics. 

## Challenges I ran into
Time! I ran out of time, but I will continue developing this application to complete my concept.

## Accomplishments that I' am proud of
This application is very dear to me. I love my diary, I lost some through the years while moving from one content to another. Until I found the chrome extension My Diary, though! I always question how secure and private the cloud is?!! With the new Web3 decentralized system, I can rest assured that my diaries are kept safe and private, until I am ready to share them or even sell them.

## What I learned
I learned the new Internet Computer and Web3, .dfx SDK, the decentralized system, Motoko back-end language. 

## What's next for Dear Diary
Dear Diary will become the first diary creator application with an actual decentralized metaverse, where users can choose to sell their diaries as NFTs.
